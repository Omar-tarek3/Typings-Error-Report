- **Error Description:**\
    The error indicates a failure to fetch typing definitions for jasmine from `https://api.typings.org/search?name=jasmine`, resulting in a 404 error.
- **Cause Analysis:**
   - The project uses an outdated method for managing TypeScript type definitions. With the rise of npm as the standard package manager for both JavaScript libraries and TypeScript type definitions, Typings became obsolete and modern projects should use @types packages from npm.
   - The Typings registry `https://api.typings.org` has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. The error is due to the unavailability of the requested resources as the Typings Definitions are no longer hosted.

- **Typings Repository Deprecation Notice:** https://github.com/typings/typings
- **npm migrating from Typings to @types:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/typings

Hence, this issue falls outside the DevOps scope as it pertains to the management of TypeScript type definitions within the project's codebase. It is a development concern, specifically related to updating dependencies and project configuration to comply with current standards and practices.
